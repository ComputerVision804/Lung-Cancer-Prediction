Lung Cancer Prediction
Machine Learning Model for Early Risk Assessment

📌 Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in patients based on clinical and demographic data. The goal is to aid early diagnosis by analyzing risk factors such as age, smoking history, genetic markers, and lifestyle habits. Built with Python and scikit-learn, the project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to deliver actionable insights for healthcare applications.

🔑 Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify cancer risk.

Data Analysis: Explores relationships between risk factors (e.g., smoking, pollution exposure, genetic history) and outcomes.

Ethical AI: Emphasizes privacy-aware data handling and bias mitigation.

📂 Dataset
Source: Lung Cancer Prediction Dataset (e.g., Kaggle/UCI).

Features: Age, gender, smoking status, air pollution exposure, genetic risk, chronic lung disease history, and more.

Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/ComputerVision804/lung-cancer-prediction.git  
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # includes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
🚀 Usage
📊 Results
Best Model: XGBoost achieved 92% accuracy and 0.94 AUC-ROC.

Key Insights: Smoking duration and genetic risk showed the highest correlation with lung cancer.
